# Federation Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PageInfo Type Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple services (orders and products) defined the same `PageInfo` type without marking it as shareable, causing Apollo Federation composition errors.

**Solution**: Added `@shareable` directive to PageInfo in both services:

#### Orders Service (`services/orders/src/index.ts`)
```typescript
type PageInfo @shareable {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

#### Products Service (`services/products/src/index.ts`)
```typescript
type PageInfo @shareable {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

### 2. Import Verification
Both services already had `@shareable` in their federation imports:
- Orders: `import: ["@key", "@shareable", "@external"]`
- Products: `import: ["@key", "@shareable"]`

## Why This Fix Works

In Apollo Federation v2:
- When multiple subgraphs define the same type, it must be marked with `@shareable`
- This tells the gateway that these types are intentionally duplicated and should be merged
- Without `@shareable`, the gateway treats it as an error to prevent accidental type conflicts

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Verify each service is running**:
   - Users: http://localhost:4001/graphql
   - Products: http://localhost:4002/graphql
   - Orders: http://localhost:4003/graphql
   - Gateway: http://localhost:4000/graphql

3. **Test a federated query**:
   ```graphql
   query TestFederation {
     # Query from products service with pagination
     products(first: 10) {
       products {
         id
         name
       }
       pageInfo {
         hasNextPage
         endCursor
       }
     }
     
     # Query from orders service with pagination
     orders(first: 10) {
       nodes {
         id
         orderNumber
       }
       pageInfo {
         hasNextPage
         endCursor
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The PageInfo type is now properly shareable across services
- Both services use identical field definitions for PageInfo
- The gateway will merge these definitions into a single type
- This pattern can be applied to any other shared types in the future

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear any build caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf services/*/dist
   ```

2. Restart all services:
   ```bash
   # Stop all services (Ctrl+C)
   # Start again
   bun run dev
   ```

3. Check service logs for any other composition errors
